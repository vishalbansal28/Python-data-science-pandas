## Pandas Data Science Tasks

This repository contains a collection of real-world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library. These tasks demonstrate the power and versatility of Pandas for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

**Goal:** To provide practical examples and solutions for common data science problems.

**Contents:**

- **Data:** The repository includes various datasets that are used for the tasks. These datasets are representative of real-world scenarios and can be explored and analyzed.
- **Scripts:** Each task is implemented as a Python script using the Pandas library. The scripts are well-documented, making it easy to understand the code and the underlying logic. 
- **Output:** The results of each task are presented in a clear and concise manner, often using charts and graphs generated with the help of Matplotlib or other visualization libraries.
- **README.md:** This file provides an overview of the repository, its contents, and the purpose of the tasks. 

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishalbansal28/Python-Data-Science-pandas.git
   ```
2. **Install necessary libraries:** 
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. **Explore the data:** Familiarize yourself with the datasets provided in the `data` folder.
4. **Run the scripts:** Execute the Python scripts to see the results and understand the implementation.
5. **Modify and experiment:** Feel free to modify the scripts, try different datasets, or explore new data science tasks using the knowledge gained.

**Example Tasks:**

Here are some examples of the types of tasks you might find in this repository:

* **Data Cleaning:**
